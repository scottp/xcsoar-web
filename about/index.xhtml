<p>
XCSoar is a tactical glide computer for the Pocket PC operating system. It was originally released as commercial software until early 2005 when it was released as open source. The open source community has taken and embraced this fantastic bit of code and improved it further.
</p>
<p>
XCSoar is now going through a major increase in features that are now very comparable and in most cases favourable to the common commercial glide computer software. See features for further information.
